# Types of Variables in Statistics

A variable describes a person, place, or thing, or idea

## Data

Observations on a single variable or simultaneously on two or more variables.

## Categorical

hair color, eye color, etc. Also called **Qualitative.** Takes of values that are names or labels.

breed of dog, type of candy,

## Numerical

Also called **Quantitative** variables. Observations or measurements that take on numerical values.

Ex: height, weight, age, etc.

### Discrete or Continuous

* Discrete - Takes on only countable values, typically takes whole number or integer values.
  * number of tails in 10 tosses
  * number of people observed at a drive thru during a certain amount of time.
  * amount of free throws in a game.
* Continuous - Can take on any value within a certain range.
  * weight (can be any value)
  * height (can be any value)
  * gallons to fill gas tank

To figure out difference - ask, can values take on different value?

## Univariate Data

Data that describes a single characteristic of a population.

## Bivariate Data

Data that describes two characteristics of a population.

## Multivariate Data

Data that describes more than two characteristics (beyond AP)

## Examples

* Gender - categorical variable
* Age - Numerical variable
* Number of boys in class - numerical
* dominant hand - categorical
* pulse rate - numerical
* eye color - categorical

### Examples - Discrete or Continuous?

* Age - continuous, can take on any range of numbers
* number of girls in class - Discrete
* pulse rate - continuous

### Unusual Categorical variables
